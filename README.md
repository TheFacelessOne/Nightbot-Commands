# Nightbot-Commands
A list of commands I've made for streamers

### Unless otherwise specified, adding these commands via twitch chat require this format:
!commands add **`<command-name>`** $(eval **`<code>`** )

To make it less likely for people to accidentally use a command, command-name should start with a prefix eg. "!slap"
