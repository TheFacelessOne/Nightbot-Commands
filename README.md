# Nightbot-Commands
A list of commands I've made for streamers

### **Unless otherwise specified, adding these commands via twitch chat requires this format:**
!commands add **`<command-name>`** $(eval **`<code>`** )

To make it less likely for people to accidentally use a command, command-name should start with a prefix eg. "!slap"

### **Some commands may not fit due to character limitations. I suggest using a [Javascript minifier](https://www.toptal.com/developers/javascript-minifier/) if needed.**
